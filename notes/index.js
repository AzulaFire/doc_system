// Development Process:
// Planning: Define requirements and features based on user needs.
// Design: Create wireframes and UI mockups.
// Development: Implement frontend, backend, and integration components.
// Testing: Conduct unit tests, integration tests, and user acceptance testing.
// Deployment: Deploy to staging and production environments.
// Maintenance: Continuously update and improve based on user feedback.

// Sections:

// Introduction: Overview of the document and its purpose.
// Scope: Description of what the software is supposed to do and what it should not do.
// Functional Requirements: Detailed description of features and functionalities the software should provide.
// Non-Functional Requirements: Performance, scalability, security, and other quality attributes.
// Constraints: Limitations on the software design or implementation.
// Assumptions: Key assumptions made during requirement gathering.
// Dependencies: External factors that may impact the project.

// ### 1. Introduction

// This document provides an overview of the design for the XYZ Software System. It details the architectural decisions, component design, and interfaces required to implement the system.

// ### 2. Architecture

// The system architecture follows a three-tier model:
// - Presentation Layer: Web-based user interface using React.js.
// - Application Layer: Node.js server handling business logic and integration.
// - Data Layer: PostgreSQL database for persistent storage.

// ### 3. Modules and Components

// 3.1. User Management Module
//    - Component: User Authentication Service
//    - Description: Manages user login, registration, and access control.

// 3.2. Inventory Module
//    - Component: Inventory Management Service
//    - Description: Handles CRUD operations for inventory items, integrates with external inventory systems via REST APIs.

// ### 4. Data Design

// 4.1. Database Schema
//    - Tables: Users, InventoryItems, Orders
//    - Relationships: One-to-many between Users and Orders, Many-to-many between InventoryItems and Orders.

// ### 5. Interfaces

// 5.1. External Interfaces
//    - Payment Gateway: Integrates with Stripe API for processing online payments.
//    - Inventory API: Exposes REST endpoints for external systems to access inventory data.

// ### 6. Deployment Diagram

// 6.1. Hardware: AWS EC2 instances for hosting application servers and databases.
// 6.2. Software: Docker containers for deploying microservices.

// ### 7. Security Considerations

// 7.1. Authentication: JWT tokens used for secure user authentication.
// 7.2. Data Encryption: HTTPS and AES encryption for sensitive data transmission.

// ### 1. Introduction

// This document specifies the requirements for the XYZ Software System. It is intended for stakeholders, developers, and testers involved in the project.

// ### 2. Scope

// The XYZ Software System is designed to automate inventory management for small to medium-sized retail stores. It includes modules for inventory tracking, sales management, and reporting.

// ### 3. Functional Requirements

// 3.1. Inventory Tracking
//    - The system shall allow users to add, update, and delete inventory items.
//    - Users should be able to view current stock levels and set alerts for low stock.

// 3.2. Sales Management
//    - The system shall support different payment methods (cash, credit card, etc.).
//    - Users should be able to generate invoices and receipts for sales transactions.

// ### 4. Non-Functional Requirements

// 4.1. Performance
//    - The system shall handle a minimum of 1000 transactions per hour without significant performance degradation.

// 4.2. Security
//    - User authentication and authorization mechanisms shall be implemented to ensure data security and privacy.

// ### 5. Constraints

// - The system must be developed using Java programming language and MySQL database.
// - The project budget is limited to $50,000.

// ### 6. Assumptions

// - The network infrastructure will support real-time data synchronization between multiple store locations.
// - Users will have basic training in using the software.

// ### 7. Dependencies

// - Integration with the existing accounting software (QuickBooks) for financial reporting.
